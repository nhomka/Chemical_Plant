This project is a fun personal project based on my senior project in 2012.  The goal here is to design a chemical plant
which produces lactic acid in such a way that we can optimize the net profit of the plant based on a given set of input
conditions (prices, output requirements, etc).  I'm looking to see how much of an improvement I can get over the extremely
tedious mix of hand calculations and Excel spreadsheets we had to update/perform any time a change was made.

This is very much a work in progress, Fermentation and Liquid-Liquid-Extraction are the only two major components that have 
been implemented.  For now, things are fairly hard-coded for the lactic-acid scenario until I can get the basics of the 
overall plant lined up to help figure out the best way to build the components and fluid streams for general usage.

First things first I'll be trying to get comments added, as I understand that as is it's fairly unintelligible.

Currently, to see what's working so far, you can run the LLE file.
